the input function looks prtty much identical to the print function but instead of the word print it got the word input
eg, a print function : print("hey, who are you?")
eg, an input function: input("hey, who are you?")
the difference is that after you run a single line program of an input function you don't get the final line
"process finished with exit code 0" 
line unless you give the program an input (given you don't have an error, if you did have an error you'd get the error information and 
"process finished with exit code 1" 
line
