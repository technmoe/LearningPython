python is a space sensitive language.
in a single line program, we have been starting to type from the very beggining of each line. 
if we intentionally add a space before the statement ( that is at a place in a program where that space should not be) we'll get an error which says
IndentationError: unexpecte indent
and our program will fail to run and we won't get our desired output. 
the process will finish with exit code 1
this error is happens in python because python uses space to identify where a function starts and where a function ends. 
python probably(will confirm later) does not use curly/squgly brackets to define the limits of a function like java or c++
this error can happen because of accidentally pressing the space key or the tab key.
innterestingly if we give space between function name and round brackets () the program will still run. 
though we'll recieve a warning by the compiler because it is not the best practice. 
another time we previously got a warning and not an error was when we left the cursor an the line we have written the statement on and not on a empty next line after the end of the program.
