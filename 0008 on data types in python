DATA TYPES

string -------
integer      |----- important and basic data types
floats       |
boolean-------

In python each function expects to work with a specific set of data tyes so there are only certain data types that can go into the parenthesis of a prticular function(and have the program still work and not throw an error).
in python there is a function called type() which is used to check the data type of any piece of data or variable

print(type("hello")) #doing this is called >>>TYPE CHECKING<<<

#output: <class 'str'>

print(type(12345))
print(type("12345"))
print(type(12345.34))
print(type(True))

<class 'int'>
<class 'str'>
<class 'float'>
<class 'bool'>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

STRING

<class 'str'>

print("123" + "345")
ouput: 123456   # got concatenated
a string is declared in double quotes

a string data type conatins a bunch of characters strunged together. in python a string can be identified by having double quotes around it. 
any data which has double quote around it in a python program is considered a string.
since we know that string is a collection of characters we can pull out any of the character from the string and add any new or old character snywhere in the string.
the position of a character is called an index.
the index of a string in python starts from 0 (zero)

print("Hello"[0]) will output H
print("Hello[4]") will output o

there is also another way of printing the last characterof the string if you do not wish to count till the last character use the negative sign!

print("Hello"[-1]) will output o
print("Hello"[-2]) will output l

when counting from the end of the string, [-1] indicates the last character of the string


This method of pulling out a perticular charater from the string is called SUBSCRIPTING



Python uses square bracket after the string to subscript. like how many programming language can also treat a string as an array.
good thing that the syntax here is simpler

INTEGER

<class 'int'>

integer is the most common number data type in programming languages.
Python can declare Whole numbers positive or negative as integers.
in pythin, in order to create or declare a number as an integer data type all you have to do is write the number without anything else.

a=123    #integer declared
b=-123    # integer declared



# Integer = Whole number
print(123 + 345)
output: 468   # got added

in python we can use the english arithmatic system to make the visualisation easier by using unnderscores to split the number in between the thousands instead of commas
when an integer has underscores in python the computer removes the underscore and treats it line any other integer so the benifit is only for humans to help visualize easier

# Large Integers
print(123_456_789)    # the number is 123,456,789 or one hundred twenty three million four hundred fifty six thousand and seven hundred eighty nine
# output: 123456789 # the computer interpreted the number 123_456_789 as if 123456789 was written

print(1_2_3) 
# output: 123 Yes, this works too!




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FLOAT (floating point number)

<class 'float'>

it is called a floating point because the decimal point (in a random list of float type numbers) could be at any position in between/at the start of the number.
so, like, it floats, literally, like in water
314.59 #float data type
31.459 #float data type
3.1459 #float data type
.31359 #float data type


# Float = Floating Point Number
print(3.14159)

314.1259_32874_8990 #is also a float

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOLEAN

<class 'bool'>

this only has two possible values: True or False
notice how the first character of both the value is in uppercase and
they dont have any quotation mark around them otherwise it would become a string.


# Boolean
print(True)
print(False)



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TYPE CONVERION (TYPE CASTING)

you do this if you want to change the data type of some piece of information or a variable.
we can use this method to convert things into all of the four major data types

int()  #  to convert valid data to an integer data type
float()  #  to convert valid data to a float data type
str()  # to convert valid data to a string data type
bool()  #  to convert valid data to a boolean data type

print(int("123"+"456")
#output:  579

though, it is dangerous because sometimes you can't convert things into a different datatype.

print(int("abc"+"123")
#output: ValueError

"abc" can't be converted into an integer.
